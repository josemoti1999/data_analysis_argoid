Most of the details are clearly mentioned in the notebook. But I will give a short summary of what was done here.

**Assignment1**
1. Cleaning data
2. Gaining insights based on country, transactionid, userid, month, year, day, time as well as aplications.
3. Segmenting UserId by K-Means clustering and a breif summary on results (see towards the end of assignment1 notebook).
4. final_data.csv is the grouped data. 

**Assignment2**
1. Predicting best 5 items bought together.
2. The answer_dict file could not be given here due to its large size. See the link below 'answer_dict.pickle'. Was not able to save as JSON version.

Below are the links to all my intermediate output files. All these can be generated using just the two notebooks.
